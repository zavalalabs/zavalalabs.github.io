In my previous post, last year about my Obsidian Journey, I've come attached to various Add-Ons that allow for my needs to be met for my note taking systems. 

During my now four years of using the application on and off, the last 3 of those years have really seen an uptick in use and with that use comes finding limitations in the base tooling. So in this blog post I will try to detail some of those add-ons that have become a favorite and how i made them work. Join me on the joys and struggles with some of my current add-ons.
