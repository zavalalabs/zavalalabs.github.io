# Into

In my previous post, last year about my Obsidian Journey, I've come attached to various Add-Ons that allow for my needs to be met for my note taking systems. 

During my now four years of using the application on and off, the last 3 of those years have really seen an uptick in use and with that use comes finding limitations in the base tooling. So in this blog post I will try to detail some of those add-ons that have become a favorite and how i made them work. Join me on the joys and struggles with some of my current add-ons. 


# All about those Add-ons

## Add-ons that work

### Countdown Timer

Simple but effective! The question that you might be asking, "Is this for pomodoro type countdowns " and the answer is no. (I think I might make a post about Pomodoro at one point.)

This add-on is actually a way to embed a simple contdown to a date and time with a title in your notes. This has come in handy for tracking down Project Start, Project Finish, Fiscal year or anything that you might be neeeding to kep track of that is time sensative that your calendar might not be able to do. 

Example in Obsidian: 

```txt
countdown
Next Fiscal Year (Current Fiscal Year: 2025)
10-01-2025 09:00
```
