# Background

Years ago, I started working on developing my Home Lab, to better my skills in systems administration and overall IT knowledge. Over the years I've touched base with virtualbox, vmware, xcpng, and even hyper-v standalone, while it was free, and even considered purchasing a datacenter license to have "ALLLL the VMS". However, cost was always a factor in my home lab. Typically, I always ended up playing with some kind of hardware that defaulted to whatever workstation or laptop that I had floating around at the time. Had it not been for a tower desktop that had been given to me from a program I was in that got shut down, I would have never had the hardware to run any kind of "server" at home.
