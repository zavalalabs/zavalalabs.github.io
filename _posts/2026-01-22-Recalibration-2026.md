# It's 2026, now what? 
Welcome, 2026; so long, 2025. The year is already off to a banger of a start. Before beginning my dive into my topics in this article, please note this entire post needs to be understood from the focal lens of my opinion disclaimer.

With our disclaimer out of the way, let's dive right on in. 


## Recalibration 

In 2026, we have many things to let go of from 2025. The one thing, however, that will not be left behind. Is passion, passion that we are on the precipice of a new day. Is that day good or bad? Well, that's on us to continue the work to make it a good day and a better day than today. Not only are we on the verge of technological improvement but also the precipiceis of the falling democracy. Now more than ever. 

In my 2026 year, I am trying to focus on new things in the tech space and how things are rpidly evolving more than i have ever felt them in the past. AI is pushing technologists to either shift focus or shift to learn new things fast. So many things are going on in that space. The main question: “What do I need to learn next”. 

In the democracy world, so much is going on and my focus now in that priate citizen space is very much shifting furhter into gear. I have in the past not been one to sit back an let injustices pass. And now i am raising my own voice where and when i can in order to keep moving the needle to a space that is best for all. 

## Political happenings and thoughts 
### National 


#### LGBTQ+ Issues 

When will we let people who fall under the LGBTQ umbrella just exist and stop attempting to legislate them out of existence and attempt to wipe them from existence in general? Too many “religious” and “politically minded people” are out here trying to rid the world of the existence of my people. It seems that with our human nature, we are consistently trying to wipe one another off the face of the planet. We seem to find someone to mark as other, and now we are seeing this mindset amplified again against the LGBTQ community. 

People, for whatever reason, found it so utterly offensive that gay and lesbian people want to marry with legal protections. Because to them marriage is a religious covenant between a man and a woman due to certain religious texts. Religious texts that do not cover all people. Why do these texts not do so? Well, the answer here is simple. Not all people follow the same religion, if that. Arguments for legislating a classification of people out of existence or rights has been used time and time again. 

With such uses as the argument around slavery (yes, these things are related) and persecution of those during World War II one would assume that notation of ["Separation of Church and Sate](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/church_state_historical.htm) would be taken more seriously. Though the confusion of this idea is vastly misunderstood. Though mentioned in the First Amendment of the Constitution and touted in conversational speak. We are not very well educated in today's society as to its fundamental principles. 
At its core, the ["First Amendment also protects people’s right to worship however they choose, or to not worship at all. Protecting people’s right to decide what is right for themselves without government interference is a key foundation (and result) of our democracy.](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/church_state_historical.htm) From this we can understand that we as individuals are not required by law to have any religious affiliation or belief. Therefore, in our creation of law and oversight. We as people in the United States should not be legislating with our own thoughts of any such god or theory of religious belief. Our right to be free from that association is paramount in our freedom to be with those that we love, in the foundation of our marriage. Within legal restrictions on marriage, that is. Too often the argument has been made or attempted to be made that in order to protect children, we must not allow gay marriage or for the gays to be visible on the world stage. Too regularly, in the last few years, I have seen many arguments for the restriction and

#### Nation Wide

On 01/07/2026, the ever-evolving use of ICE in the local communities spiked. We saw with our own eyes the [killing of Renée Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Ren%C3%A9e_Good) 
and this was thought to be the tipping point of our current interactions with the group known as ICE. However, now having to update this later on in teh same month, we now see another interaction [killing of Alex Pretti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Alex_Pretti). The continued interactions resulting in deaths are overwhelming; this in history was something we in the United States would have pushed back on in any other country. Yet its happening on our doorstep. We, as always, are out here pushing into the deeper throes of being anti USA. We are now the antithetical version of ourselves. Not only are we as a country allowing this to happen, we are not doing anything to stop it.  When I say this,  “We” in this context is the larger USA Government and representation. There are countless people out marching and protesting to protect the rights of our fellow human being in this country. Our representatives have los ttheir teeth, we the american people have lost our teeth with our representatives.  We call, we email, we fax and what happens? It feels like nothing. 
As noted on The View, Sunny Hosten brought up a very big point that has enumerated my thoughts and feelings on teh murder of Alex Pretti. To use her words "Harkening to the time when america got really engaged after the murder of the two wthite men in the race riots, then the FBI opnened the field office to investigate " [^1]

> Does writing this put a target on my back? Sadly, I fully believe it just might. As many who have come out and posted anything, be that on platforms like TikTok, Twitter (it won't be called the new name here), BlueSky, Instagram, the list goes on and on. Calls for the public defaming of these authors and calls for people to lose their jobs are far too many. Freedom of speech is not without danger. In today's world, these dangers and daggers are mainly pointed at anyone who does not align themselves with those creating the chaos we are seeing. 


### International

#### Venezuela 
This first entry into the year is off to a deeply unsettling start as we continue to see more and more focus in the USA on those that don't fit the narrative of the current administration. In today's political world, there is much that can lead to our words and ideas being taken in the wrong context politically, but this is one of those times when, in 2026, we are fresh from the international activities by the [USA in Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_United_States_strikes_in_Venezuela). These actions taken by the administration are certainly cause for alarm. As someone who grew up during the attacks of [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) and the subsequent war that ended up lasting roughly 20 years, it's not lost on me that we are again facing a potential new forever war, except now we are the ones doing the most wrong here. We invaded (again) another country and asserted ourselves as being some kind of global police. When in the same breath some will say, “The US cannot police the world.” The
