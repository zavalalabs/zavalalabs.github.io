# It's 2026, now what? 
Welcome, 2026; so long, 2025. The year is already off to a banger of a start. Before beginning my dive into my topics in this article, please note this entire post needs to be understood from the focal lens of my opinion disclaimer.

With our disclaimer out of the way, let's dive right on in. 
## Recalibration

## Political happenings and thoughts

#### Venezuela 
This first entry into the year is off to a deeply unsettling start as we continue to see more and more focus in the USA on those that don't fit the narrative of the current administration. In today's political world, there is much that can lead to our words and ideas being taken in the wrong context politically, but this is one of those times when, in 2026, we are fresh from the international activities by the [USA in Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_United_States_strikes_in_Venezuela). These actions taken by the administration are certainly cause for alarm. As someone who grew up during the attacks of [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) and the subsequent war that ended up lasting roughly 20 years, it's not lost on me that we are again facing a potential new forever war, except now we are the ones doing the most wrong here.

When will we let people who fall under the LGBTQ umbrella just exist and stop attempting to legislate them out of existence and attempt to wipe them from existence in general? Too many “religious” and “politically minded people” are out here trying to rid the world of the existence of my people. It seems that with our human nature, we are consistently trying to wipe one another off the face of the planet. We seem to find someone to mark as other, and now we are seeing this mindset amplified again against the LGBTQ community. 

People, for whatever reason, found it so utterly offensive that gay and lesbian people want to marry with legal protections. Because to them marriage is a religious covenant between a man and a woman due to certain religious texts. Religious texts that do not cover all people. Why do these texts not do so? Well, the answer here is simple. Not all people follow the same religion, if that. Arguments for legislating a classification of people out of existence or rights has been used time and time again. 

With such uses as the argment around slavory (yes these things are related) and persicution of those during World War II one would assume that notation of ["Separation of Church and Sate](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/church_state_historical.htm)
