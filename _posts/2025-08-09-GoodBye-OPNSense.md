OPNSense, it was nice(?) while it lasted. But now, it's time to say goodbye. 😢

I want to first start off saying that I think my issues with OPNSense mainly come from the hardware that I decided to deploy it on, but the software itself is still not great. PFSense was great and I used it for many years, but OPNSense has been a pain. 

My main issues with OPNSense have mainly focused around how the UI is laid out and how to navigate it. That was something that with more time would have been overcome, however the straw that seems to have broken my back the most was the firewall rules. Trying to get certain firewall rules to work that I had previously integrated just fine in PFSense was more than a pain. That would be putting it lightly.
