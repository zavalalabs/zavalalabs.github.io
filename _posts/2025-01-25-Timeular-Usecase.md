# Time tracking, the never ending need

In almost any buisness or in any job position, there is usually a call, typically from inside the organization, that almost any employee or technologist will face. That call or question usually is; "How much time have you spent working on XYZ project/ticket/task/etc." It's never a fun conversation to have and usually a pain to have to reacall what you did the day before or even the last quarter. If you track these items and tasks then things would be easy. But for many that brings up the question of "how can I track this?" 

For me the answer years ago was this little company called Timeular now [Early.App](https://early.app/).
> Why Timeular? Why use it? WHy not just use a spreadsheet or a note taking app?

So many reasons come to mind when trying to answer this question. But as with anything that you look at when investigating a new productivity tool, is "What is going to work for me". Too often times others will try and tell you "THIS IS THE END ALL BE ALL FIX IT TOOL" and that does nto work. Part of ansswering this question is looking at your own needs and how your brain works to answer the question of "What did you do today?" or "How long did it take you to work on this XYZ Task/project?"
