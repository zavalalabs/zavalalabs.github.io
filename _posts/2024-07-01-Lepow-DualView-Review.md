I had not envisioned doing any kind of dedicated hardware review on this blog. But after the experience I had with the Lepow DualView, I felt compelled to share my thoughts. Specifically, I wanted to share my experience with Lepow's Indiegogo campaign and then go into the actual product. It's been almost a year in the making of this whole process, since I first backed the campaign. For simplicity sake, I will break this review into two parts: the campaign and the product. Let's dive in!

## The Campaign

This campaign kicked off and garnered great interest after ads and youtube content kicked off the concept of the unit. When the ad first tripped across my feeds, I was instantly intrigued with getting this kind of tool into my gear back as a hybrid worker wanting to have my own setup wherever I was deployed. Many concepts were a tossed out thinking about how this product would work. 

So, did I jump right in? **You Bet I did** the promised delivery was even more enticing.

### Frustration

As time went on as you can see in the timeline listed above, I maintained some patience since this was, what I was viewing as an innovation in the mobile monitor market. 
## The Product


### Unboxing 

#### Reality Vs Expectations

A generic apple cable?! For a monitor??? Come on folks! I was expecting a USB-C to USB-C cable. I mean, I get it, but I was hoping for a little more than a generic wanna be apple cable. This looks to have "fallen off the back of a truck" written all over it.
