# AI is a Work Multiplier

Employees all over the world have started to leverage AI tooling in their day to day work. Some may be using it in Google email composition, or using AI-generated summaries for long, complex emails to better understand the context of long emails. Does anyone else ever get randomly CC'd on an email thread that is 15 emails long and you have no idea what is going on? AI can help with that. (If you have not yet tried that and you got that idea cooking in your brain, go try it out now; I will wait.) Isn't that nice? (I hope you tried it and it worked well for you.)

Getting back to it, when you use AI to streamline your order of operations or workflows, you are using the latest tools to optimize your time. As any employee knows, time is what we get critiqued on the most. “Hey there, Bob, what do you spend your day doing? How long did it take you to get the Anderson project summary done?” Using AI to help reduce the amount of “Oh no, this is the same thing i do every Monday, and it takes me 2 hours to do it" type of work is a great way to optimize your time. Or better yet, let the AI help you make the proper template so you can plug in the variables instead of writing the whole thing from scratch every time. Not everyone has the space in their brain to remember every little detail, and AI can help with that.

# Automate the boring parts (wait, that's a book already out there)

For those of us in the IT space, trying to remember every business process is not only time-consuming but also something that can be second nature to many of us; then, when we are asked to teach it or share it, we draw a blank. Using AI to help automate or document these processes so it can be repeatable or shared with junior members of the team is a great way to leverage AI as a work multiplier. 

Dont get me wrong! I know what many IT people are thinking....

> "If I document everything, I might get replaced by a bot!"
> 
> "If I automate this process.... I won't be needed anymore!"

It's a completely valid worry. I have actually asked myself that question so many times. But here is the catch: once you automate that step, now you have to MAINTAIN and MONITOR that step to ensure it's working. You created that logic; you have to ensure it keeps working. So now instead of doing the boring task, you are now doing a higher level task of ensuring the automation is working properly.

Don't let AI just make the product and run with it. Use it to learn how that process can be automated; take the time to read the code, the logic, and the flow. You can learn while doing new things and getting time back in your day to focus on higher-level tasks.

We are all in this new modern world together. Embrace the change, learn the new tools, and use them to your advantage. AI is here to stay, and those who learn to work with it will be the ones who thrive in the future workplace.

Happy Automating!
