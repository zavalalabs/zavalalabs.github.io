| Note1                 | Supports online firmware upgrades to ensure compatibility with the latest devices.                                                                                                                                           |
| Note2                 | The AC cord has double insulation protection, and the product is UL and CB certified for safe use.                                                                                                                           |
| Note3                 | We recommend using the provided AC cord or a standard C7 2-pin AC cord with a current rating greater than 4.0A.                                                                                                              |
| Note4                 | To achieve power levels above 100W, use an E-Marker USB-C cable. Note that Apple's Thunderbolt cables support only up to 60W.                                                                                                |
| Note5                 | The power distribution shown is for illustrative purposes only. OTA upgrades or different firmware versions may result in optimizations and variations in power distribution.                                                |
| Note6                 | Due to proprietary charging protocols, the Surface Laptop Studio 2, Dell XPS 15 (9500/9510), Dell Alienware X14, and Dell Mobile Precision 5570 cannot be charged at full speed.                                             |
