# Summary


# Things You *think* you know

Just jump in and drive! While yes that's true, just be gentle on that accelerator! Even the lower end models of electric cars have some good get up and go. 

Jokes aside, the car should always operate as a car, things are different yes, but the main things are just the sound and the expectations of performance. 

Charging you think will be easy, and for the most part they should be. If you own a home you will be on the fast track to a good charging experience. For those in an apartment however you might have a rough go at first but thinking ahead as an apartment document might be needed.

## Public Charging Infrastructure
### EVGo

####  EVgo Autocharge+

##### The good and the bad: 

The concept is great and more places should adopt it, in practice, it is a pain to setup.  In my local area where we have decent LTE/5G connection on mobile devices, attempting to setup the AutoCharge+, all i got was errors left and right, took about 15-20 minutes and 2 different charging location.
