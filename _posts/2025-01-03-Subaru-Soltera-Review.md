My Open call for Subaru to fix some things with your Toyota counterparts:

### Instrument Cluster

* Get rid of the "Ready" light or let us turn it off. 
	* This has to be one of the most annoying icons on the cluster. I know the car is on and ready to go. When its not ready you already flash a warning on the screen over and over. 
* Front crossing warning
	*  When i turn this feature off, leave it off! This warning system is a good tool but when you CAN see traffic in front of you I don't need extra warnings, maybe for first time drivers its fine but experienced drivers its a nag that does not need to be around. 

### Mobile App
