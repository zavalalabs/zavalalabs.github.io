### 12-Volt Battery Discharge
Any observant reader of many of the forums or searches for this issue, will  note that these 12-volt batteries are far too underpowered, and while many seem to have no problem with the 12-volt battery in warmer climates with fewer issues. In colder climates, the 12-volt battery will have a painful experience. In the latest cold snap in January 2026, i had my second experience with the 12-volt battery. Even after a full warranty replacement of the battery, encountered yet another failed attempt to enter “Ready” mode. This issue made it seem as if the main traction battery had dropped from 55% to 0 with one cold night. That is unacceptable even for an ICE vehicle. 

# Areas for improvement

My open call for Subaru to fix some things with your Toyota counterparts:

### Instrument Cluster

* Get rid of the “Ready” light or let us turn it off. 
	* This has to be one of the most annoying icons on the cluster. I know the car is on and ready to go. When it's not ready, you already flash a warning on the screen over and over. 
* Front crossing warning: 
	* When I turn this feature off, leave it off! This warning system is a good tool, but when you *CAN* see traffic in front of you, I don't need extra warnings. Maybe for first-time drivers it's fine, but for experienced drivers it's a nag that does not need to be around.  When this system is on, and you can already see, an extra alert makes you second guess what you are  already doing. 

### Mobile App
In 2025 we saw a much-needed upgrade to the mobile app, now featuring actual Soltera-focused items. The one downside even in 2026 is the limitation of the 20-minute run cycle. The message should be, should you decide to attempt to run a second go of the automated start. You get a notification that the engine has already run and is not allowed to exceed 20 minutes.
