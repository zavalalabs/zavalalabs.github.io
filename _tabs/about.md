## Hey, I'm Chris! 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a Systems Administrator with nearly 15 years of hands-on experience in IT, currently at NCAR where I focus on macOS engineering and systems administration. But if you're here for the tech blog, you probably care less about the official title and more about the actual stuff I work on.

### What I Do (Day Job Edition)

At NCAR, I spend my time keeping macOS environments running smoothly, supporting the engineering group, and making sure researchers have the tools they need. I've also had the pleasure of supporting CISL's SiParCS & NESSI programs, working with interns to ensure they have access to the computing resources they need. Over the years, I've picked up some pretty useful skills along the way—PC deployment, network design, server installations, macOS deployments, JAMF Pro management, and even some SharePoint administration (yes, I survived that).

During COVID-19, I got recognized for my remote support work, which was rewarding but also exhausting. It taught me that good tech support is really about understanding people's frustrations, not just fixing problems.

### What I Do (Blog Edition)

This blog is where I share what I'm learning, experimenting with, and occasionally complaining about. You'll find posts about:

- **Home Lab & Infrastructure** — My adventures (and misadventures) with Proxmox, networking, and whatever hardware I'm tinkering with this month
- **macOS & Admin Tools** — Deep dives into Apple ecosystems, JAMF, and keeping things organized
- **Reviews & Gear** — I like to test out tech and tell you if it's actually worth your money
- **Productivity & Personal Systems** — Tools like Obsidian, time tracking, and how I try (and often fail) to stay organized
- **General Tech Thoughts** — Random observations about IT, working from home, and the future of technology
- **Political & Social Commentary** — Occasionally, I dive into local, national, and international issues that have a broader impact outside of the world of technology (see my [Personal Opinion - Disclaimer](https://blog.chriszavala.com/disclaimer/#:~:text=Personal%20Opinions) )

### Why This Blog?

Honestly? I've always found it helpful to write things down. Whether it's documenting a problem I solved, sharing something I learned, or just venting about technology decisions, writing helps me think. If any of this is useful to you, then that's the cherry on top.

### Let's Connect

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/zavalalabs) and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/chriszavalatech.bsky.social) if you want to discuss tech, share ideas, or just say hello.
